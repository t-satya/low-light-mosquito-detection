# 🦟 Low-Light Mosquito Detection & Classification with YOLOv8

This project aims to detect and classify mosquitoes in low-light conditions using object detection techniques. Built as part of a deep learning challenge, it leverages **YOLOv8** for accurate detection and multi-class classification of six mosquito species.

## 🔍 Objective
- Detect mosquitoes from noisy, low-light images
- Classify them into 6 species
- Support public health efforts by automating species identification

## 🧠 Model
- **YOLOv8** trained using Ultralytics framework
- Custom dataset of labeled mosquito images
- Image augmentations for robustness

## ⚙️ Tools & Frameworks
- Python, PyTorch
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Albumentations (for augmentation)
- OpenCV, Pandas

## 📊 Evaluation
- Performance measured using **mAP (mean Average Precision)**

## 📁 Files
- `mosquito object detection and classification.ipynb`: Full notebook including training, evaluation, and inference

## 🚀 Future Work
- Improve generalization to real-world conditions
- Create a web app (e.g., Streamlit) to upload images for mosquito detection
- Try edge-device deployment
